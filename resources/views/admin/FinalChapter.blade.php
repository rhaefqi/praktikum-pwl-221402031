            after all this time with her, i need to know her again? <br>
            days by days weeks by weeks months by months i spend with her made me think there is nothing i dont know abut her,
            but i was wrong i was so wrong i hope this time i'll get her to be completely mine. <br><br>
            one whole semester already passed know we study about her but in a completely different way, native php we used to know
            is nothing compared to laravel it is easier to use yet harder to study it, with all of knowledge about her in the past 
            i try to know her better this time we start at using template again but this time it has blade in it, i dont know what will happen 
            in the future but im not thinking to throw all this love for her, like i was say i will use it to make her completely mine. <br><br>
            this is my first task with her in a different way <br>
            whis me luck with her and "her" also heheheeh
